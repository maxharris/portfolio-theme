		<h3>Hello!</h3>
		<p>
			My name is Max Harris, and I am a professional front-end developer based in San Francisco, California. I build marketing sites, e-commerce platforms, blogs, and applications for small businesses, startups, and non-profit organizations. I also teach WordPress fundamentals at General Assembly,The Academy of Art, and as a consultant.

			My mission is to build and ship tools that revolutionize access to education, entrepreneurship, and political engagement. Ideally, I would like to lead front-end development for scalable, community-facing products in these areas.
